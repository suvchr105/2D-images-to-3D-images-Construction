# 2D-images-to-3D-images-Construction
The goal of this project is to convert 2D RGB images into 3D representations using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict depth maps. These depth maps are then used to generate and visualize point clouds and optional 3D meshes. A Streamlit interface is provided to support interaction.
